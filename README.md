# App Compat 9
App Compat 9 - see what apps or games you can still use on iOS 9. Some install normally, some require older versions and work, some require older versions and only work with workarounds. **This list is still a work-in-progress**.  
# Emoji Meaning
📄 - Info.plist Method (installing an older version of the app (👍 method) and changing Info.plist's CFBundleVersion and CFBundleShortVersionString to the latest version's number shown in App Store that is right below the app's name)  
👍 - Older Version Method ("This app isn't compatible with device. Install newest compatible version?" in App Store)  
🤔 - Partially Works (add downsides here)  
😀 - Fully Works  
😳 - unsure
## Apps
### Social Media
Apple Apps - 👍😀  
YouTube - 📄. 🤔 using this method (home page and search don't work), 😀 using web version  
VK - 👍😀. You have to enable logging in by password, though  
### Games
Minion Rush - 📄🤔. Costumes tab crashes, then the game endlessly plays a cutscene after reentering the app  
Subway Surfers - 📄😳. Seems to work
